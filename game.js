let board = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8];
//so lets create a board, 0, 9 because that's how many spaces are in a tic tac toe board
let turnCounter = 0;
//this will be handy in case of a tie
//x will go first all of the time
let currentPlayer = 'X';
//so from a simplistic level, i'm thinking while gameOver is false; 
//we swicth turns between X and 0, and accept an input, that input represents their turn 
//if it's a legal turn
//after the turn we need to check to see if the game is over, if not, then the next player goes
//
